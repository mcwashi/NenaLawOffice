					<div>Nina represented my school district in a difficult case involving felony theft by an employee. She brought closure to
						the school board with a successful conviction. I found her to be very organized and prepared as she maintained the
						highest degree of professionalism. Nina has excellent people skills and will work well with anyone requiring legal
						assistance.
					</div>
					<div>I became acquainted with Nina a year ago, as she was handling the Chapter 13 caseload of one of the larger Chapter 13
						filers in our region. I found her to be a highly competent attorney in what is certainly a complex field of the law.

						<p>I became acquainted with Nina a year ago, as she was handling the Chapter 13 caseload of one of the larger Chapter
							13 filers in our region. I found her to be a highly competent attorney in what is certainly a complex field of the
							law. What impressed me as trustee was that she was equally adept at dealing with her clients, creditors, other counsel,
							myself and the Court. She was always very professional and respectful to all parties, and successful in resolving
							the issues that relate to a Chapter 13 filing. It should be noted that not every practitioner is adept at dealing
							with debtors, who are often in very stressful situations. In my view, this is one of Nina's strongest attributes.
							I'm excited that Nina is re-entering the bankruptcy realm, and I know she would be most helpful to anyone in need
							of such legal assistance.
