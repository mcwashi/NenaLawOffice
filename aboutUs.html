				<p>
					Nina Gougis is a long-time Peoria resident who has dedicated her career to helping those in need. Her focus is providing
					effective and affordable legal services in the areas of civil rights litigation, labor and employment law, business
					law for small- and mid-size businesses, bankruptcy, family law, adult guardianship, adoption, and general civil litigation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Nina began her legal career at a large school law firm located near Chicago and in Peoria, Illinois. During her time there,
					Nina trained under some of the state’s most highly-recognized labor and employment attorneys. She successfully represented
					large- and mid-size employers - including Peoria Public Schools District No. 150, and other school districts and municipalities
					- in a wide variety of labor and employment disputes, including disputes in federal and state court, the Equal Employment
					Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR), the Illinois Educational Labor Relations
					Board (IELRB), and the Illinois Labor Relations Board (ILRB). Nina also regularly advised management on employment best
					practices, employee rights, and employer responsibilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					After several years representing management, Nina decided to fulfill her dream of representing individual clients. She began
					working at a debtors’ rights and family law firm located in Peoria and Pekin, Illinois. While there, Nina was trained
					by one of the top bankruptcy attorneys in the area and quickly gained expertise in the areas of bankruptcy, debtors’
					rights, and family law.
				</p>
				<p>
					Being no stranger to adversity herself, Nina displays a deep compassion for all of her clients, helping them navigate what
					often are the most difficult times in their lives. She strongly believes that every single client deserves the very
					best of her efforts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nina’s tough, but fair, effective and level-headed approach to the practice of law helps to ensure that her clients receive
					the very best outcome possible in a way that keeps costs to the client as low as possible. In addition, Nina strongly
					believes in keeping clients in-the-know about their cases by promptly returning phone calls, providing regular updates,
					and communicating with clients in a way that is easy to understand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of her practice, Nina is dedicated to public service and helping to improve the lives of all Peoria residents. She
					currently serves as an executive committee member, communications committee chair, and education committee chair of
					the Peoria National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Nina also is a proud member of the Peoria
					Alumnae Chapter of Delta, Sigma, Theta Sorority, Inc. She is extensively involved in local community services projects
					through both organizations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nina also is active in the Peoria County Bar Association, having served as chairwoman and current member of the Association’s
					Diversity Committee. Nina is admitted to the United States District Court for the Central of Illinois, the State of
					Illinois, and the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central Illinois District.
